# Stock Ontology

This project is an ontology of Apple stock prices from the last 5 years (December 24, 2020-December 24, 2025), represented in RDF/Turtle format. It models daily stock prices as the entities Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume for semantic web and ontology applications.

## Files
'yahoo.py' - Python script that grabs pubically availble stock prices from Yahoo Finances
'AAPL_5years.csv' - Apple stock prices from 12-24-2020 through 12-24-2025, taken from publically available data on Yahoo Finance using 'yahoo.py'
'csv_to_turtle.py' - Python script that converts AAPL_5years.csv data to Turtle format and writes all ontological objects in RDF and OWL
'aapl.ttl' - Output Turtle file generated by csv_to_turtle.py
'README.md' - Project description and usage instructions

## Features
 - Downloads publically available information on Apple stock 
 - Converts CSV data into RDF/OWL/Turtle triples
 - Generates clean, machine-friendly URIs for open, close, high, low, and volume
 - Ready for use with knowledge graph tools like GraphDB

## Requirements
 - Python 3.x
 - yfinance library
 - pandas library
 - GraphDB

# Usage
 - Upload 'aapl.ttl' into GraphDB
 - List is ready to visualize ontologies and run SPARQL queries

# What I learned
 - This project mostly taught me about using OWL to better define instances in an ontology.
